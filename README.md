# Observation 
 This work is in collaboration with my friend Youssef Lachhab so I collaborated with him for his project    [Predict tags on StackOverflow with linear models](https://github.com/youssef-lachhab/IDDL) !  


# Neural machine translation system
 Machine translation is a challenging task that traditionally involves large statistical models developed using highly sophisticated linguistic knowledge.

 Neural machine translation is the use of deep neural networks for the problem of machine translation.
In this project , we  will discover how to develop a neural machine translation system for translating German phrases to English.

# Loading  the dataset
  I  uploaded  my dataset  [deu.txt](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1LYw_wl5ftE4ejhFPFpfar4lt1HvNKZgN)  in my google drive, i make it public  because its size exceeds the size limit allowed by github (25MB)
and during the execution of  this notebook on google colab I load it in  colab system space


Visit this website : [Bilingual Sentence Pairs](http://www.manythings.org/anki/) if you want to try more dataset of  Bilingual Sentence Pairs
they all have the same structure ( Tab-delimited Bilingual Sentence Pairs )
